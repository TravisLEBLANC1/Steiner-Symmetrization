# Steiner-Symmetrization
A graphical representation of the Steiner Symmetrization, converging to the Euclidiens ball
using python and mathplotlib


## Usage
To use it you need the python library mathplotlib (see https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html )

then you can launch it with main.py

## Goal

The goal is to provide a graphical illustration of the Steiner Symmetrization for our Bachelor's Math Project.
It's a symmetrization of compacts sets throug hyperplans, Which is used to proove the isoperimetric inequality.

## Alternative usage
The module Steiner_Sym is not design to be used outside. 
However it is possible since it is doing the symetrisation on a polygon indepently of the rest.
